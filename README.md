Algorithm behind ticket booking is:

One person can reserve up to 7 seats at a time.
If a person is reserving seats, the priority will be to book them in one row.
If seats are not available in one row then the booking should be done in such a way that the nearby seats are booked.
User can book as many tickets as he/she wants until the coach is full.
